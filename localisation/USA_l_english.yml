 USA_combating_jim_crow:0 "Southern African-American Marginalization "
 USA_combating_jim_crow_desc:0 "The Southern defeat in the American Civil War and the self-perceived humiliation that was piled on in the Reconstruction Era was too much for the Southern planter and business class. They channeled their frustration with recent political disempowerment, and used it to conspire against the newly empower African-American population. Southern political scheming culminated in the Compromise of 1877. The Compromised saw the formal end to Reconstruction in the South and the last protections for the African-American communities and politicians in the south lifted. The compromise was functionally a betrayal and abandonment of African-Americans by their Northern political allies.\n \nSince then hostile Southern state legislators prompt by an even more hostile population have passed laws that marginalize African Americans. Laws that separate African-Americans from the rest of the Southern populace on the basis of race in public places while also suppressing their right to vote. While also at that same time the populace in these states practices its own extra-judical campaigns to terrorize and torment African-Americans. These practices have been called ‘Jim Crow.’\n\nWhile we do currently have more pressing issues, we cannot ignore the fact that the practice of ‘Jim Crow’ continues to strain our country. A country that promises ‘liberty and justice for all.’"
