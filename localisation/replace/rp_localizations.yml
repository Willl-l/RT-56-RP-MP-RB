 prepare_for_the_revolution_desc:1 "We have no time to wait for the slow changes in the minds of the people. For their own sake, we must force the matter swiftly, even if some may lose their lives in the process.

 #Events for Neutrality Decisions
 neutrality.1.t:0 "[Root.party_name@neutrality|!] Demand Referendum"
 neutrality.1.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] party movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many supporters are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the [Root.GetAdjective] party may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."
 neutrality.1.a:0 "If the people want it, we'll hold the referendum."
