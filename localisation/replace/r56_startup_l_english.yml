 r56.startup.event.01.description: "Hello and Greetings from the 56 Team!\n\nPlease help us make your gameplay experience as optimal as possible by indicating if this session is for a multiplayer game or not. It really helps us balance everything and reduce suffering.\n\nImportant Notice: This mod officially updates every month around the 7th/8th (with the occasional delay). We recommend that you finish most of your games/campaigns before those dates since most of our updates tend to break save games. Thanks for your understanding.\n\nThank you for playing our mod, and have a wonderful day!"
