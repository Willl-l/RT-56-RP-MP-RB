#1964:
#commander in 64 Namgyal Bahadur
# former Quartermaster General of the Royal Bhutan Army Bachu Phugya
#Jigme Palden Dorji prime minister in 52
#Sonam Tobgay Dorji important advisor in 1936, reformer
#Sonam Tobgye Dorji = tobgay
#Jigmi Y Thinley foreign relations

#I will try Jstor to make it complete
#In 1935, during His Majesty Jigme Wangchuck’s trip to India, it was believed that Sonam Tobgye began a “systematic review of  social  conditions,  administrative  practices  and judicial proceedings,”   which   brought   about   new   reform   in   the Kingdom  (Aris  1994:  135).  Taxes  were  paid  in  various  forms such  as  firewood,  hay,  rice,  and  woven  cloth,  depen
#ding  on the  district  of  which  the  Bhutan  House  collected  for  the Second King of Bhutan. This form of taxation soon ceased.
#So a guy named Sonam Tobgye.
#maybe Rani Chuni Wangmo. (a woman)
#Bhutan’s  foreign  minister  (1949) Jigmi  Y  Thinley
#Jigme Palden Dorji late PM
# Tslzogdu national assembly
