 r56_italy.1.t:0 "The King Removes Mussolini From Power"
 r56_italy.1.d:0 "Following an emergency meeting requested by King Victor Emmanuel III, the latter met with Mussolini, asking for his resignation, pointing in particular the enormous debt in which Italy finds itself and that the latter has not been able to resolve in almost fifteen years of power, the economic abyss that was the Ethiopian campaign, as well as the problems caused by the embargoes suffered following the invasion.\n\nUnder pressure from the Grand Council of Fascism, which began to turn against him, particularly under the influence of the royalists who tried to make a bigger place for themselves, Mussolini had no choice but to accept the order, not wishing to face prison. Pietro Badoglio was then appointed Prime Minister. The latter, despite his many links with the fascist administration, is seen as a much more moderate figure.\n\nIt is clear that the King is trying to save the face of Italy, whose situation is constantly falling apart."

 r56_italy.2.t:0 "The Ethiopian Armistice"
 r56_italy.2.d:0 "One of Badoglio's first objectives was to end the costly conflicts in Ethiopia. The new Foreign Minister, Alfredo Covelli, was sent to negotiate an end to hostilities between our two nations, and managed to negotiate peace, but forced us to pay some war reparations for the many civil destructions that took place during the conflict."

 r56_italy.3.t:0 "The New Cabinet"
 r56_italy.3.d:0 "A few days after his appointment as Prime Minister, Pietro Badoglio formed his new government. Even if Badoglio still claims to act on behalf of the Partito Nazional Fascista, the fascist influence has been reduced within the ministries, with the participation of many monarchists in the new cabinet, probably under the impulse of the king, concerned about the new problems that could arise from maintaining the economic and social policies of the fascists."

 r56_italy.4.t:0 "Giovanni Messe's Proposition"
 r56_italy.4.d:0 "Giovanni Messe, Major General, former Commander of the Third Cavalry Division, and Minister of the Interior in the government of Pietro Badoglio, today approached the latter with a rather specific proposal. It was indeed clear to Messe that Badoglio's ultimate goal was the removal of the fascists from power.\n\nThe latter suggested using potential monarchists in Blackshirts and other organizations very close to the leaders of the Partito Nazional Fascista in order to eliminate the party's leading figures from within. Thus, once deprived of its leaders, the elimination of its last elements would be possible without having to shed too much blood."

The position is now vacant, largely reducing any risk of being uncovered by the latter."

 r56_italy.6.t:0 "Fascists Blame The Communists For The Assassination"
 r56_italy.6.d:0 "The murder of Arturo Bocchini shocked many executives of the Partito Nazional Fascista. In "Il Popolo d'Italia", the party's official newspaper, one could see \"The resurgent communist threat\" written in large letters, indeed blaming potential members of the Partito Comunista Italiano for the assassination.\n\nLuigi Russo, leader of the Blackshirts, called for increased vigilance by the latter against any element deemed \"anti-fascist\"."

Under Italy's leadership, a second version of these protocols was signed, including a military alliance between the three nations.\n\nMany see this as Italy's attempt to find a place in Europe after leaving the League of Nations, and to prevent Germany from integrating Austria into the Reich."

In exchange, the French and British governments agreed to lift the embargoes on Italy.\n\nTheir aim is to maintain the territorial integrity of Austria against the German Reich, as well as to ensure that the latter respects the Treaty of Versailles.
