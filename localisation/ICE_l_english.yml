 SCA_iceland.1.t:0 "Consider a Invasion of Iceland"
 SCA_iceland.1.desc:0 "Denmark has fallen, but their subject, Iceland remains free from German interference. However we have reliable reports that suggest that Germany may be interested in Iceland as a staging ground for an invasion of Scotland.

 SCA_iceland.4.t:0 "Iceland Requests Volunteers"
 SCA_iceland.4.desc:0 "One of our small partners, Iceland, has requested volunteers in order to help them drive the revolution forward. Although not powerful, Iceland is in an extremely strategic location near the British Isles, and providing them with men may be an excellent way to prepare ourselves for a possible confrontation with the imperialists."
 SCA_iceland.4.a:0 "We shall give them as many men as we can!"

Claiming to be representing the "will of the people", [ICE.Fascism.GetLeader] has proclaimed himself to be the new head of government which is to be restructored away from the parliamentary model, and towards a corporatist model with [ICE.Fascism.GetLeader] at its head.

It is time that we decide once and for all if they are truly a guard force, or indeed the navy and air force of Iceland."
 SCA_iceland.9.a:0 "They are both."
 SCA_iceland.9.b:0 "They are our navy, first and foremost."

 SCA_iceland.100.t:0 "Neutrality of Iceland"
 SCA_iceland.100.desc:0 "Denmark, our partner in the Union of Denmark and Iceland, has fallen to the German invaders.
